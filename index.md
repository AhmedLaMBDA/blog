Hi there ðŸ™‚
My name is ***Ahmed*** and I do ***Software Engineering***

- The mission is ***liberation from the Van Neumann style for software design***
- The ultimate goal is ***simplicity***, but as you might know, simplicity is hard -- so here I'll write down the good stuff my eyes lie on and the things I create/find/learn on that journey.

Former Software Engineer for ***(Amazon Web Services)*** and two other beautiful startups ***(100Worte + Plural)***

Giving some more credit for this blog to the 100Worte team who introduced me to the beautiful world of functional programming and Lisp dialects

I'll never compromise elegance, once again, never.
