## Introduction
My name is **Ahmed** and I do **Software Engineering**

I've been doing so for around 6 years now, former Software Engineer for ***(Amazon Web Services)*** and two other beautiful startups **(100Worte + Plural)**

## Mission
1. **Liberation from the Van Neumann style for software design**

2. **Let's have wings, let's fly.**

## Goal
The ultimate goal is to achieve ***simplicity***, but as you might know, simplicity is hard -- so here I'll write down the good stuff my eyes lie on and the things I create/find/learn on that journey.
